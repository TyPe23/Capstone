# Trilleon
A complete integration automation framework (and unit test framework) for Unity

The Trilleon test automation and unit test framework is a comprehensive library of code built for C# in the Unity engine. Modeled after Selenium, it is the first comprehensive Unity toolset that allows you to build a complete automation (integration) test framework inside of Unity. Additionally, it allows you to write non-standard unit tests that can test code that cannot be tested at compile time (such as IEnumerators or context-specific logic).

For an extensive explanation of the framework, along with tutorials for setup, deep dives into the functionality available, and much more, visit the Trilleon Wiki, now located in this github repo's Wiki section.
