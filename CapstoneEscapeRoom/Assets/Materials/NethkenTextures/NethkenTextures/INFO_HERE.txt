I compiled the files I could find from my team's Nethken project in CSC470.

It consists of most of the indoor assets I used to remake Nethken's inside. I don't have the assets for the outside walls, etc.
so you will have to find some brick textures if you recreate the outside.

Any custom models or textures I created are found here as well as a few textures I found online.

There are some models such as doorknobs, lights, and other furniture that I found on sites like TurboSquid or pulled from QuixelBridge
but it would be rough finding them again so I leave that to you.

You will most likely have to play around with the materials to get it looking right with scaling and such.

Hopefully this will at least get you started on your project.

If you could credit me, it would be much appreciated. I go by Eli Payton.

Good luck!
